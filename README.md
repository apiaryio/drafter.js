# drafter.js [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/apiaryio/drafter.js/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/apiaryio/drafter.js/tree/master)

Snowcrash parser harness

`drafter.js` is a pure JavaScript version of the `drafter` library. It
is built from the C++ sources
using [emscripten](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/). It's
API compatible
with [Protagonist](https://github.com/apiaryio/protagonist), the
Drafter Node binding.

## Installation

drafter.js can be installed from NPM, or it can be downloaded from the [releases
page](https://github.com/apiaryio/drafter.js/releases).

**NOTE:** If you're using Node, we recommend that you use the [Drafter
NPM](https://github.com/apiaryio/drafter-npm) package instead of drafter.js
directly. Drafter NPM will attempt to install the pure C++ parser and fallback
to using drafter.js.

```shell
$ npm install drafter.js
```

## Usage

### Node

If you've installed drafter.js via NPM and using drafter.js in Node, you can
require it via:

```javascript
var drafter = require('drafter.js')
```

*Node versions supported*: >=4

It works on 0.10 or 0.12 too but without any guarantees and expect it to be
significantly slower.

### Web Browser

If instead, you are using drafter.js in a Browser. You can include it via the
HTML script tag.

```html
<script src="./drafter.js"></script>
<script src="./drafter.js.mem"></script>
```

### API

Once you've included drafter.js, you can parse an API Blueprint:

```javascript

var res = drafter.parse('# API Blueprint...', {generateSourceMap: true}, function (err, res) {
    if (err) {
        console.log(err)
    }
    console.log(res);
});

```


Supported options:

- `generateSourceMap`: Set to export sourcemap information.
- `json`: Set to `false` to disable parsing of the JSON data. You will
  instead get a JSON string as the result.
- `requireBlueprintName`: Set to generate an error if the blueprint is
  missing a title.
- `generateMessageBody` - Enable generation of messageBody from MSON (default: true)
- `generateMessageBodySchema` - Enable generation of messageBodySchema from MSON (default: true)

Or if you want just to validate it and are interested only in parsing
errors and warnings:

```javascript
var res = drafter.validate('# API Blueprint...', {requireBlueprintname: true}, function (err, res) {
    if (err) {
        console.log(err)
    }

    if (res) {
        console.log("Document has semantic issues!");
        console.log(res);
    } else {
        console.log("Document is valid with no warnings.");
    }
});
```

Supported options:

- `json`: Set to `false` to disable parsing of the JSON data. You will
  instead get a JSON string as the result.
- `requireBlueprintName`: Set to generate an error if the blueprint is
  missing a title.

### Note

These are not a real async API calls - their presence is merely for API compatibility
with [protagonist](https://github.com/apiaryio/protagonist)

#### Synchronous API

Both functions have their synchronous counterpart which instead of callback return the result and in case of error throw exception.

- `parseSync(source, options)`
- `validateSync(source, options)`

### Build drafter.js

Unfortunately building drafter.js works only on a *nix environment at the
moment.

1. Building is easy using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

2. Build

    ```shell
    $ ./scripts/wrap.js
    $ docker pull "apiaryio/emcc:1.37"
    $ docker run -v $(pwd):/src -t apiaryio/emcc:1.37 emcc/emcbuild.sh
    ```
    or with `npm`
    ```shell
    $ npm run build
    ```

3. Check out the `./scripts/test.js` and `./scripts/test.html` files for
   example usage. You can also use `npm install` and then `npm test` to run the
   tests.

The resulting stand-alone library `drafter.js` is in the `./lib` directory.
Don't forget to serve the `drafter.js.mem` file as it is required by
`drafter.js`. There is also a single-file version in `drafter.nomem.js` that
can be used, but it may take longer to load in a web browser
environment. It is the default for node.js enviroment.

To get a debug version or version enabled to be used with `emrun` run
the `emcbuild.sh` script it with `-d` or `-e` respectively.

#### Squeeze the size

If you want to squeeze the size to a minimum install
[uglify-js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2) and try running
`uglifyjs lib/drafter.js -o drafter.js -c;`, this will use
`uglify-js` with compression, beware that this might cause some
errors, if you encounter them try `drafter.js` without it to verify
that it is caused by `uglify-js` and report it please.
